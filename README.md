Hello, my name is Justyna Toporkiewicz. Welcome to my Git Repo!

During my studies I have worked with many different technologies, from C to React.js, so I am capable of working in many areas of software development. However, I have found that working in the front-end area, and especially with React.js and Redux, is the most satisfying to me.

Currently, I am starting a new personal project using Node, React and Redux, which will be a user friendly guide for Xenoblade 2, aimed at helping completionists (such as myself) in finding everything that the game has to offer.

I am keen to work more on interesting and exciting projects, especially front-end projects.

I can be reached via my email: justyna.toporkiewicz@gmail.com, or via my LinkedIn profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/justyna-toporkiewicz-b57b33156/
